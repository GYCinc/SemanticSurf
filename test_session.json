Student: I think present perfect is for experiences and past simple is for completed actions. Teacher: That's correct! Can you give me an example? Student: I have visited Paris last year. Teacher: Close! That should be 'I visited Paris last year' because you specified when. Student: Oh I see, present perfect doesn't use specific time markers. Teacher: Exactly! Now try: Have you ever eaten sushi? Student: Yes, I have eaten sushi last month.",
