A: if i know the the son of the uh chief of police i can uh do he can did some i don't know a uh statement or what do you need for the passport but here's the thing in united states you can do it okay but
B: this wouldn't be happening in the united states no one would just steal your like that would be the difference right this is the difference is like and in fact in a lot of places i don't think people would like it's such a serious crime to steal a passport like like only in somewhere in mexico is it so corrupt that you could do it without any worry of consequence like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah like i don't know it's mexico like they're not even going to try to investigate it so i don't know we'll see like again i don't think so i don't think i agree with what you said like at the time i confronted him because i was trying to move my landlord was trying to rob me i was having like a nervous breakdown i was really frustrated so like and i wasn't even trying to accuse him but then like he said something and i was just like well i remember it just set me off but it sure that's a whole nother thing like i don't know i'm gonna just like my landlord i will see him again and then make my like kind of see just you know like he said something we you know he did something weird to me just a couple days ago talking he's like oh is roger still there and roger's like the psychopathic irish guy who was like stalking me and i'm like hey um you live in a small town and you know his landlord wouldn't you know he's like oh see i'm like why did you ask me about someone if you know like you're pretty much neighbors with his landlord like you know more than i do but he didn't
A: now you are freeze
B: he thinks like i do and he's a mexican but he has a family so there's not like so okay maybe i found one guy but he's got a family three kids his cousins live in the same place you know this other than like becoming part of his family like literally like that's not a you know i can't and i also don't like how dependent i became on them and i feel like actually in the end that i felt manipulated by them because he knew that like i kind of depended on them and i he says no but i confronted him i was like hey man i think you like i i'm sorry but we put this all out on paper and you just read this story tell me what happened like take your name out and take my name out of it let's see it just doesn't look good man like it just looks like you knew as soon as you didn't want me to be independent because you got a lot out of me you know and like helping them with paperwork in english and things that like they they would have had to pay lawyers for everything else in this like thing because here's the thing like the overprotective like going back to your house i don't think that's inherently a bad thing i think it's inherently a bad thing when because you have that you think that trying to do something for the sake of doing it is stupid like bettering yourself is bad is essentially what someone's saying like learning to be on your own like the fact that that like culturally as uh an entire country one hundred million people they they literally do not see this is troubling to me not it's fine it's not my country like but like it's troubling
A: of course of course but in in five years you are you are alone there you are only on your own
B: i but i was really close with one family and i i mean i practically i don't know if i lived with them but i was around them for multiple years and i will tell you that
A: what happened do you hear me i don't hear you no no i i uh can't hear you
B: like that's why i'm living here like i really want to talk about it the thing is is he's like kind of like pro pro a lot of trump things he doesn't understand them it's okay right like he can only get the tick tock you know he doesn't have the whole story so i really don't blame him like he's not a stupid guy if i was just hearing all of this stuff for the first time too that is being recycled to him that's like twenty years old he's like oh wow yeah george soros and i'm like okay but
A: yeah point is like ah um you need you have another class now
B: no no no he canceled he moved his class until wednesday
A: um no no i i i i try i trying to to ask the when you confronted confronted he he still being a good friend
B: it's kind of hard to describe everything that happened going um i uh have this guy that i told you about his neighbor is like the chief of police so i really want to get the like the nuncia official before i go to mexico city because this will be the second new passport i've gotten in mexico so i need like to show that i did a denuncia and um i got to do that uh and yeah but but
A: you you need to to to see the the good the good thing there is that you can ask your friend that is the son of the poly chief police officer to to in states you can't or no
B: what do you mean
A: that in latin america everything everything is possible with i don't know well
B: no yeah lives at home the girl before that she's like twenty she's a little younger i don't know maybe she lives at home maybe she doesn't i'm sure she does what am i kidding um i i can't think of a single girl that i've met that doesn't live at home this goes for guys too i mean it's just at some point again no it's wild and i think that this
A: no no no sorry i i yeah uh
B: i'm not talking about twenty five year olds no no no yeah
A: yeah i thought i thought you was talking about ah that that type of
B: i'm talking about thirty five year old males and women men
A: and women yeah no no that is normal that latin america the people work and studied at the university living in her in their parents house but then then they leave the home like everyone
B: because how do you not just want to like anything time quality these are like eighty percent of the problems and i just realized this i'm like oh you just have to uh so first you open your mouth and then sound comes out and then those are words and then the other person will and then you'll solve the problem
A: yeah yeah but here here in chile they said or they say uh maricon son riente that the people who don't tell you the problem face to face and tell you no no no problem number but they they they have all the anger inside and cat you no no catch you no i ah don't know how to say to to yeah put a knife in your back yeah uh when you turn around
B: yeah so this this whole concept doesn't even exist here
A: it's very common here and they here they don't used to they don't used to accept the honest of the not the honest the the the yeah that's
B: the thing is that's what i was gonna ask you like what do we even call this what do we even call this because we can't say honesty because it's not honesty is like like there's like another word or thing
A: yeah to to to to say the things that you think and um uh face to face to other people the we the argentinians are buried directly when when we speak yeah we say the things that we think in the face of the other people
B: yeah that's why you live in a country in theory yeah right like if like this is like the human experience is giving your opinion like like the whole pur of existence yeah
A: but here is not common it's they used to they used to
B: hide pretend
A: hide the the opinion or or i don't know why
B: fake as yeah it's not even hiding like i'm done i'm done making excuses it's like a cultural like that's why i gotta find a new word for it like it it isn't this like it isn't being polite no no it's not
A: no no no if
B: you make a bigger problem by not talking about something that is not polite it's something and i don't know what the word is for it but it's it's not polite right to and then just think oh we'll just deal with the disaster that is sure to come of my inability to be an adult later and that's the polite thing to do this and then when we deal with it we won't ever think about having avoided the whole problem with like one sentence right there's a word i don't know what it is but i can't it's i'm gonna kill so i'm gonna literally kill someone over it like i can't yeah i can't yeah
A: in the past in my in my first years here uh in in other job not in not in the
B: in
A: i'm working now
B: yeah uh
A: my boss told me hey don't don't be uh don't be such directly with the people because here the people is not
B: they're not used to it
A: the people don't used to know your the the truth the truth yeah no i don't know but if if i uh i want if i need to tell you ever trust
B: this person to do what they say he just doesn't have a concept there's no mexicans
A: are uh famous in that
B: right but you think after five years you're gonna find some people right that you're good that you know that's that's my point is like eventually you think you're gonna find some people and and again are they around sure but there has to be enough of them that as just being a normal person that i can meet them right like i can't have start a facebook group like in colapa like looking for non you looking for people that are not little bitches uh like looking for people that are the same maturity as their actual age yes like looking for people who are who are capable of having con yeah so i don't know all i know is that i my first theory and i can test this easily is that any place no matter that it is like envied to be a grown man living with your mom if you can is just ridiculous and immaturity is the only reason why people can't have difficult conversations there is no other reason it's not being polite it's just you're immature you've been babied your whole life and you just yeah
A: they they live with their mothers at what age
B: forever now uh
A: thirty years
B: yeah of course you get it yes absolutely
A: no yes i thought that you you are uh talking about the the the the the the young adults of twenty five years
B: forty
A: no no no that that's not common no no in other country you find uh different things i think if in latin america i mean
B: okay so my theory so far so my working theory and if it's wrong then it's wrong is that that this would automatic not automatically so the two things that i would identify as like the like the patient zero of the things that i that i personally think like affect everything is this the like the accepted dependency like this is like zero fucking respect for people being independent and like trying things and like you know and this this polite thing but i think that they're related right like i think that there's a uh people i think there's a lot of people i know there's a lot of people mothers that under their breath are feeling like like go go do something dude like but they're never gonna say that never they're never gonna tell their son to go away i mean very rarely so i think that any culture for example here's a working theory that uh i can test that where it is a normal thing to just leave the house or at least try before you're like twenty one and under let's say twenty two even like after school like i believe that the effect the domino effect of this will eliminate the vast majority of it i do um
A: right
B: i will never like most people i will always hate most people like this is a fact but but it doesn't it doesn't mean that like i can't understand people it doesn't mean like i can't like like i think i'm so i think that this is a huge huge huge thing that just again it spills into everything i mean think about how
A: yeah yeah but but uh again that thing uh is not common in latin america uh yeah you are american you need to go uh to a uh other state to to go to the university and work in other in the other part of the country but in latin america that is not the common
B: but even if you don't you still move out if you just just because you want to hang out you don't have just moving going to university is just one of the reasons why it is so normal but it is not like even if you're not going and you're staying in your town you want to move out
A: yeah ah maybe but but but i think the the the same thing that you see now in mexico uh you will see in probably all the countries here uh even in costa rica or brazil too uh uh
B: it's not you don't think even just being able to communicate no i agree with you no i agree with you one hundred what i'm saying is like and and i am also aware that like the way uh there's a million people that are think like me that i'm sure my my point is is if you go somewhere and get thrown into like a like a bowl of people like what is your highest probability of like finding someone outside of it so i guess i'm just saying like the percentage right um yeah i don't know i i again i i'm gonna find out like i'm gonna explore like but my theory my working theory is that let's we'll use brazil as an example because i know at least in the city from talking to people that it's super common to at least try and move out so i can see like but no my opinion is that i i don't think the grass is never greener on the other side right the grass is greener where you water it you know your house is greener where you make the best of it on the other hand i don't think it's irrational for me if i come to this conclusion to think okay if i can't meet anyone that is my age that has ever lived independently is going to be really tricky like how do i relate to someone that has not in my opinion had any life experience at all or
A: no no no no no you you might i think you you can find that kind of person maybe in mexico city
B: exactly yeah
A: not not in guanajuat the cashier the cashier he said oh like who's next and
B: i said oh can i and he just yeah like i didn't like like i wasn't there
A: ah uh he he he uh attend the dilemmas not you
B: yeah because he like saw them first like he didn't want to like have to look at me and be like oh ma' am he's next like he didn't want to have that non confrontation confrontation that was much for him to be like oh man he's next oh well because that's how uh the human brain and order people in time talk to einstein like i don't know like we're doing time like this like what it's just i'm not even mad at him it's just i'm annoyed with him right he's just doing his job like whatever but like how like four women four different families you would hope like four different people all just like like what do they think like like it's just out of this world man like i can't imagine i feel like i could be a black man in a bar in texas and i would get treated better than that like like it's just crazy like i just can't so let me ask you this confrontation what kind of human i don't mean like race or where they're from do you have to be really gentle with because you don't want to hurt their feelings what kind of humans children
A: yeah everyone
B: but i mean like but especially children right you can't especially
A: children or or teenagers yeah uh very very very old people
B: right exactly people invulnerable people that exactly so we know like the the the the crazy like the the the the consequences of the mama right we know the consequences of this
A: no what is mona guyina mama
B: gaina like overprotective mothers and like latino families again not a thing in brazil people in brazil move out when they're eighteen do you know that yeah ah this is normal even if they fail they at least try they at least try to go get some independence and then the move back okay cool but like it's a thing like people want to be on their own they want to experience life wow um and so these are the people that you have to be so you got to be super polite to people that are immature and people are immature because they never do anything for themselves they don't like cook clean have a struggle cry get their heart broke like and then you're in this like so so something's got to give like and you know why because it would just be so rude francisco to tell people hey you're like twenty five you're kind of a loser why don't you go out and like try something so there it is there's the politeness like oh that would be mean would it isn't it more mean to let someone turn into a little
A: you are very angry
B: oh oh yeah like i'm not angry i'm just fed up uh i'm just i'm like because i used to be angry i used to be hurt i'm like wait wait no oh aaron you're being this way you're being that way no not like this is what happens you're too afraid to tell anyone when something might be better you're too afraid to have an honest conversation about like how you're a little and and so like now you're just going to keep passing this on for generations and generations and generations and you're not going to be able to tell your employer this you're not going to be able to like you can't ever have a conversation that isn't easy you're not going anywhere and you're gonna have to have the hard conversation with your kids you gotta move out like you gotta do something like like the economic progress in mexico are from factories that chinese people built like in every single like facet of the culture like this inability to challenge or do anything difficult it manifests itself into like every little corner of like economically like education like it it pushes itself like it's it's so unacceptable to challenge anyone or to like push anyone in even a positive way that uh like it spills into every part of people's personal lives and this is why you can't give them feedback well they're still children man like it's not like they're still children you know you could give a fifty year old feedback he'll be open to it but like your whole population is twenty years immature what are you going to do like what do you do like where do you go from there i think it's like really fun
A: but do you think that
B: and i don't i am the last person that wants to uh i'm hyper aware of how much time energy and adaptation that a person has to put into everywhere new right so like i get that like i've been through it even just moving from from north to southern california was really hard when i was twenty two like really hard so i get it uh but again at the same time i could deal with like just ten less shittiness you know like i don't need i don't need like the whole i don't need to be like in a utopia like i just what i feel like is that not even like one out of fifty are people that i want you know it's just like i know i don't i don't think it's the same in every country i really don't and if it is i'll find out but i don't i don't think i think that there are small cultural differences and expectations that drastically shift people's mindset and and what they see is valuable again i mean the concept weird is weird no
A: no i think i think you are in the in a very particular city i i don't know i know all the mexicans are uh out of that way
B: they're more than you think like this like okay i do live in the extreme but this is super common in the whole country you see memes about it so it can't just be me so but whatever we'll see in like november or december i'm gonna go for just like vacation or whatever i'm gonna go to the place in brazil you told me about i'm gonna go to florianopolis yeah and also because there's uh another place that is like about two one hundred and fifty kilometers from there like these mountains that i remember i said ooh i want to go here too and i thought okay if this is relatively close to florianopolis done deal like this is all like the serendipity that i need
A: right
B: two places in a massive country that are you know travel
A: yeah yeah
B: i don't know it's just funny
A: and another another thing when i was in boston uh in one meeting the ceo of commerce did a speech uh for all the countries yeah and he used the word no how
B: do it
A: yeah and instantly i remember you
B: wow
A: see yeah
B: i don't mean to sound full of myself but what i want to tell people is like if i'm using it you need it sounds like really conceited but it's just because i'm conditioned like i'm conditioned so if i'm using it it's probably common like i'm not like trying to be you floyd sorry driving nuts today everything's driving me okay so he used the word serendipity i love it of course he did of course he did smart good people like this word
A: can i say that yeah yeah no no i remember i i i started to laugh uh inside of me in front of him because wow i i don't know the meaning but i remember that word
B: i shouldn't remember that word damn it you're like see this is the problem like you never heard this word in your life and then all of a sudden you need it during like the key the keynote speech you're
A: like oh no no no incredibly great two days before you said it you said uh
B: yeah i mean is there's not a really good word to to replace it that doesn't sound like hippie talk you know like everything just kind of you know it's just it's like a so there's not a lot of ways to say it
A: yeah i don't know i don't remember the meaning
B: oh uh it's like luck coincidence like meant to be
A: ah yeah
B: yeah i don't the big realization that i've had isn't that uh the people don't exist here they do or i haven't found it's that how much like am i gonna spend my whole life trying to find three people that i can relate to right like uh it isn't about if they do exist or don't exist right like it's just so it's just about like who are you gonna surround yourself with like who are you going to i understand it's always hard to find good people everywhere in every country but i don't know that you know you're
A: yeah yeah you you you are you are ah searching for people with almost yeah just
B: a little bit a
A: normal goal in a normal goal in in in in his life anything
B: literally anything or like yeah or like i i just yeah like i i was gonna i was thinking like i was feeling pretty positive on friday and i was like yeah uh you know i told my friend i was like hey come over here i wanna i'm using his amazon account and i said come over here i want to explain a few things his plan and i'm like essentially telling him like yeah ah you could help me like work with me and he doesn't come for three days and i'm like yeah man i don't sorry i'm kind of over it now i don't takes you three days to walk ten blocks like go fuck yourself like you'll never do anything you're never and if you do the first time you'll have money you'll just get drunk for a week and you you'll just you'll fuck everything right like that's yeah
A: i i think you are doing a generalization uh
B: yeah but but it's five years now that i haven't had other experiences so that's what i'm saying like i'm waiting like everyone even this person that i live close to i like the last couple weeks i've been trying to get him to walk ten blocks to my house i've been to his house so many times like it's so i could show him some things on the computer and he would just rather like be drunk at his house at ten blocks away or like do nothing or like just it's just like it's like wow like even this person who i generally like like i could never
A: yeah now i hear you bad i give it time
B: i see you freaking probably man like demand that you have tell you you're going to have a better experience uh you should just be using properly usually no like if you didn't know how to like reset everything twelve times you'd never know why oh it's just complicated
A: okay but
B: preply will definitely have this guy's going to retire a billionaire after he sells all of the information for these although he can't really unless it's in the terms and conditions and they say they delete everything so i don't know he's ukrainian though we can't trust him so yeah how uh how was the week how's life
A: good very good i i've been in in boston last week
B: yeah i was boston
A: yeah very very nice weather
B: yeah yeah um
A: now it's a boring city but unless you
B: like to get drunk and have fights
A: yeah yeah yeah more or less more or less this
B: is like the only thing to do in boston is ah be drunk and angry
A: yeah yeah the the people the people there are uh yeah are angry all the time the people in the street i don't know one day we are a uh group of or party of five people walking on the street and uh a woman almost uh for forty years old i don't know she she she went went us uh in the street and because we are five we are chatting yeah and she she she can't she couldn't pass as quickly as she wanted to yeah yeah and um she she she began to to insult us uh uh and um i don't know uh
B: what kind of insults ah what kind of insults just like you or like cursing
A: yeah yeah yeah not not xenophobia another uh day i was smoking in the street and some guy ah starting to do do some uh yeah no no they are they they are very particular in his ways but but i don't know
B: yeah i mean it's it's there i guess there's a there's something in between right because that uh that is probably i don't know every you know we have to decide what it is because i i've noticed recently i forget what group i have like a couple of facebook groups that are in spanish that i just read and ninety of the problems don't exist they're just people too scared to be honest with people about important things you know like they aren't probably the problem does it only exists because somehow especially here it's it is just absolutely outrageous rude and you may as well kill yourself then like be honest with someone and make something better you know like hey i expect better i need better i need you to like this makes you a bad person even though in reality it everyone including you to just hold no standard of anything at all ever there's just no standard of like they just they say things and like okay well you know that like most people pay to live right to like not be homeless but no like no m my landlord has a literally think about this like a given like he has a business he was like gifted that he had to do nothing with he's forty years old still lives at home like he is he has the ability capability he just doesn't wanna because it's not no one would care like it's not respected uh and that's what that's the part like how is it you how is it you could move out on your own accomplish cool like be independent and people will look at you and insult you for doing it oh you abandoned your mother like was she like luzima no no no oh yo oh uh you're just no it's really really it's it's it's like a bunch of crabs in the bucket but times ten yeah i will tell you that let's see the last girl i was talking to is thirty one but
A: yeah why is you stealing
B: well because the i want land like i want beautiful land for cheap and i want to live on it and i want to feel like it's mine and it's like good weather you know like weather is important weather's a pretty big deal of
A: course of
B: course
A: yeah so
B: i don't know i could just like uh stop trying to expect anything from people and try really hard but the last six months i felt like i made a pretty strong effort to make to even just make friends with people that were outside it's just it's still so hard i'm like dude like you guys are like you know like even just making friends it's so much work it's like hey i don't like just i don't know it's like so much work yeah it just seems like it's not worth
A: the effort because because you are you're in a city that the people is not uh for the people it's not common to to related with foreigners uh
B: but the thing no isn't it normal when you are a person from anywhere and you meet a person from anywhere else that you're at least mildly interested in like oh hey like where are you from and like what do you eat like no i think this is normal like i watch tribes in africa be interesting you come here and they're like where are you from oh do they have tacos no oh it then i don't want to talk about it or hear about it oh it's a new flavor oh it's a new song it's a new music uh it's not me i hate it like i've never that to me is the difference like how is it possible to just hate everything that you don't know so instantly without even trying it we don't we don't like that like we don't yeah
A: yeah yeah that that that the name of that is ignorance they they they they afraid to know something new
B: so i don't know i think
A: i don't know i
B: just i yeah i don't think that no i don't think that there's a place like magically where knowing like latin america where it doesn't exist i just do wonder if now mexico and where i am is like i mean i think of all the latin american countries i would imagine that they this happens in order of economic stability or opportunity in mexico being so so low like and so you know guatemala uh honduras you know same i would imagine that it would be very similar same like you said though with cities right it's just on a different scale like in a country with more so but then again i don't think that it's inherently true like i don't think it has to do with just money i think culturally like being independent building something for yourself like being proud of being independent is something that just doesn't exist here there's like you tell someone here like you moved out you're living in your own house like it is a huge deal in here they're like oh you're stupid you should just be living off your mom and spending your money on whores like there's like actually the mentality
A: yeah yeah
B: versus maybe
A: maybe because the people that ah has uh some ideas uh or some independence move to uh other city
B: they're definitely not hanging out where i am because they probably felt the exact same way exactly yeah
A: the same way that you are feeling now
B: because yeah i used to think the big difference is that i've come to this realization is not because only it's not only because i'm a great guy and this is what i and i i just i i use this as my excuse for a long time and partially yes but it isn't exclusive to that right like that's what i told myself for many years why it didn't bother me as much i'm like oh no no you just don't understand give it more time like you're good and then once i finally feel confident like oh i get it no it's just as stupid as i ah thought right that's the hard part preply this is this this chat just got like red flagged eight times they're like we gotta get him his chat what is this guy doing yeah we heard twelve in four minutes we gotta check
A: yeah yeah yeah we are joking mister prepley
B: but it is funny because you know there's got to be a flag in there for like i don't know like
A: no yeah in that way and and that way and the and the way of the earthquakes no but chile is near argentina it's part of uh the same and they are yeah we are we are separate by the the losandes mountains yeah
B: i was gonna say uh i don't even have to look there's some geographical historical thing that made going between the two extremely difficult and i don't even have to look it up because in everywhere it's not a separation of boundaries of countries these are just we made that up right it's geographical and like logistical right this is our culture
A: um yeah yeah
B: you'd be you'd be interested i probably i don't know now go ahead let me just make a note i'm going to tell you a quick anecdote that you'll be i do want to forget but i don't want to interrupt
A: no no no you are not interrupting nothing you can you can tell me about your anecdote okay
B: this is my anecdote you already know
A: no sorry
B: you already know how i feel about like what i just told you and things like this that have bothered me and yesterday i just wanted to go and there's like the uh okay maybe i give a little context there's like the the like the weekly tanges is on my street but i'm not in the t i'll just say the street that is normally with cars it's a lot of people so there's a lot of people in general just it's more crowded in the neighborhood but regardless i went to just buy a energy uh drink because i just didn't feel like having coffee you know and so i bought an energy drink and uh there is i'm there's nowhere to form a line in this store like many small stores right but it's pretty obvious who's in line you're standing in front of the cashier and the short is like i watched this one lady walk in front of me the first one and i was like all right uh that's kind of on you let's let's let's like change your body posture a little bit i mean she's a but whatever i'm gonna work past it and then like three more women proceed to try to like position themselves even after seeing me like to just go in front of me with no eye contact no nothing and i'm like he the guy's like who's next and i like was was like yeah yeah that's me and then this other woman just starts to buy and i'm like the woman next to me who unfortunately was attractive i didn't give a at this point she was like oh are you next it's like yeah well uh why else would i be standing here like i'm just here in the store just like hanging out like i have something in my hand of money and a can in my hand the woman in front of me gets mad like she's like she doesn't even look at me she just storms out like and i'm like and and the guy who's paying he's not he doesn't work there a lot but i know who this guy is i'm like did you really just not even acknowledge that i said i was next like i just wanted to burn the whole fucking store down and like this this does not happen anywhere else nowhere like yeah like it i mean like there's just people like all drunk ladies and whatever like there's there's people all over but like this is not happening like four or five people don't walk in and the place this is the storehead live next to so it's not like i'm just in some random part of town like like on uh what world do multiple people all women above the age of thirty decide that like the line literally probably one of the most oldest human interactions in the world to line up and wait for something is just so beyond them or they don't care because they're all like fat and hot like i don't give a man like i wanted to burn the place down like i was so i i was so angry that i came home i'm not joking started watching uh my first series in brazilian portuguese i was like this i'm done i'm done like you cannot like you you you in this whole let me so let me ask this question so who think about this you do i'll give you that
A: sorry i i didn't understand
B: oh just that
A: no no no
B: yeah and they'll tell you it's because they have to take care of them it's not
A: no no no no uh
B: they don't want to pay rent they
A: are not not older to to to
B: no yeah you
A: need to uh
B: this is one of the first realizations that i remember having in mexico and it seems so obvious now but i was like and i remember talking to someone i was like you know what's weird i don't think i know i think i've met anyone that understands what paying rent is like nobody understood i mean they understand where rent is but like they had never had the experience of working and paying rent like no one and i remember i remember being like huh it's a time again it's just like the beginning of this i'm like well this is a trip well if you've never paid rent how do you know what it like feels like to like do something good you know what i just i just remember like yeah uh people here don't understand where rented value i mean it's like you imagine from a woman's perspective no wonder she wants everything handed to her and from a guy's perspective this guy has never so i told someone yesterday i was like literally like not to be disrespectful the only way you could approach living here is you should literally assume that everyone is fifteen years younger mentally than you're speaking to like that's the only way you could approach like if i had to just give you one rule of thumb um apply this all over in your workplace that's the only thing you could do that would get you anywhere because you know like okay he's thirty five how would i talk to a twenty year old kid oh yeah have you like that's pretty much what would work and that is uh fifteen years immature isn't bad like there's nothing wrong with being childish and happy and carefree but like i don't know if you want to like accomplish something or i don't know like i don't know like feel like you're making the world uh better uh or happier i don't know it's just stay up late and drink beer naked in your living room like you just want to do things yeah like again even if you feel fail you're still gonna try right like yeah yeah ah here you gotta just stay at home so you can save all your money and spend it on coca cola and ugly i don't know no
A: no i i know i know a lot of of people that fail in in that thing but they they reuse go back to mother's home they they with uh with a uh friend or exactly
B: yeah you don't go back home like like what i get it you love your parents but like who in their right mind wants to be with their parents day and night you just have to wonder about the trillion different ways that this like affects your how you see the world and like what what's important
A: no no that's not common in in argentina exactly argentina any country no no
B: oh okay no i have never never met gone on a date or talked to a girl that i liked who lived by herself never not once in all of mexico now but
A: they are uh single they were single yeah ah they were single uh anywhere from twenty five to forty
B: not only um one one one woman one woman in aguas cliente she's like like whatever she the only one that lived by herself or did no lived outside of her house with roommates by herself with anything i bet right now if we went downstairs god dude if we could make some kind of game about like who lives at home either with their mom or their grandma
A: that uh you that thing and i will tell you in your face not not with other people i don't i i don't need to go through other people that to tell you the things that i think uh i will tell you the truth if you do or did something well i will do that you did something well but if you did something wrong i i i i will tell you
B: yeah how else could you be expected to improve it's okay it's okay to do things wrong
A: yeah
B: you do it of course it's part of the process you don't know what's wrong if you don't know what's right and you don't know what's right if you don't know what's wrong you gotta try no no problem
A: and of course of course uh but it's part here is part of the culture to be to be nice to be to be polite in that way uh but then they they put a knife in your back instantly
B: uh but so how do you deal with that
A: i don't care i i i still saying the the things that i think yeah
B: and do you think that that is uh
A: i'm i'm some some guys offend uh get offended but i don't care uh it's my my it's my it's part of i am life man yeah the
B: thing is if if this was like not the norm it would be one thing but the norm is everywhere in the entire world to do this when you're an adult right it's just a normal thing like it isn't like so i i think you're doing them a favor you're like welcome welcome welcome to the rest of the world guys um when you do something terrible we're gonna tell you because in this this one there's two things this is one of them i think like just my opinion right if this was like a game of sims if i could like make a cultural shift or like make adjustment in a game and two things i think i completely like transform without doing anything without changing any government like i think if you change a couple of little values that this just dominoes into like massive differences in a place this i think is hands down maybe actually probably comes before everything you uh got might come before everything else because i i think this is like a cancer i really do like i don't think people underestimate how big of a deal this is like how little happens because no one's honest because a lot of people don't have a problem improving for other people
A: but like you think that the american uh culture is not honest
B: no it's definitely like compared to here it's like brutally honest i mean uh yeah but compared to like german culture we're we're still soft but it doesn't matter
A: of course of course but comparing super the the latino way
B: like in argentina you say it's not this bad so you can't just latino right that's the thing is it's not just latino it can't be i don't know everywhere is like this um no no and
A: the brazilians not also yeah i like open indirect
B: yeah open very open people like you're not going to uh and i'm sure there's other countries too i'm sure it's not just argentina brazil but it might be it might be just because they're you know location geographically argentina and brazil just took on this way of you know i mean this is like a small thing that takes generations so it could just be you know but i don't know um it's like mexico no yes yeah yeah not like in the ohio of mexico
A: yeah yeah
B: i live in the ohio of mexico if you moved to ohio i'd be like dude you're gonna kill yourself there you're going to commit suicide you're like no no it's good it has a good price of living it's cheap i'm like but you're gonna die of like depression and anger because the it's the same thing like i live in the ohio of mexico i get it i know but i it up now i lived in ohio now it feels bad to move to los angeles and mexico it's just not the same like it's just like
A: no no but but you know but if you try uh a few a few months in mexico city maybe you can
B: expensive though i honestly just too expensive man
A: yeah but but if you if you uh change uh to another ohio of latin america you maybe uh find the same kind of people mhm because the people that move in our countries move to the capital city
B: cities yeah
A: exactly people
B: that are willing to get outside of the box are in those cities for that reason yeah yeah yeah no i agree
A: and you will find the people that don't move or didn't move and um still in the in the like their hometowns are
B: to the same hometown stupid rednecks different rednecks exactly yeah
A: yeah but but brown necks
B: yeah exactly
A: latin america
B: yeah this is like the way of saying redneck you know i mean like i mean not exactly obviously but i uh don't know i'm just you know what's interesting i was i just learned why they call them rednecks and it's not because of the sun on the neck no
A: it's not because of the tin no
B: what is it called i don't remember but damn was i disappointed i can't believe how how many times i perpetuated this lie uh no it's because of something else it's uh
A: i thought because they are farmers yeah
B: of course right no okay hold on let me check real quick no it's not it's it becomes from ah yeah okay because now now it says that there's no definite meaning no for sure meaning um i think so here this person says it may come from the sunburn but i had it on good authority that it was from that it had to do with just like blue and red uh like politically um but i guess it works
A: but blue is
B: they used to wear red uh handkerchiefs to political rallies to identify and they call them rednecks they were like ribs so i don't know but i think both
A: yeah but but but the the blue is for the conservative party or not no
B: liberal
A: liberal blue is liberal
B: yeah exactly so um yeah no you're i mean it could be and that's okay like i'm okay with that but i just have a suspicion i just don't know i don't know if i i don't know man i just don't know if i could live in mexico city you're right though
A: but but if you move to monterrey of course it's not better than guanajuato
B: no it definitely is a hundred times like anywhere that you go somewhere where there's gonna where there's more economic opportunity there will naturally be uh but i don't know the way that i feel is like dude if i'm gonna if i'm gonna actually even go for that big of a move then i'm gonna make a way bigger move like why not like i don't have any you know like if i'm gonna move states i may yeah countries like go to el salvador or something like i don't see the point right in going yeah uh uh
A: another city there yeah you need a big move
B: it doesn't make sense to go through the effort the only other place that i i did i could go to oaxaca live on the beach and oh uh people from everywhere girls from everywhere like very worldly but not expensive either to be honest not expensive at all so i don't know i have to maybe i gotta console enough that like i keep making this joke about like if uh mexico you know they're gonna me because my visa's been expired and deport me i think it's pretty obvious that like if it happened i would be happy because it would at least take that choice away from me you know i wouldn't have to make a choice deal i'd be like okay cool ready hey someone send me my stuff cool thanks i'll be in guatemala at the border i would just have someone drive it to me like drive me my i'm gonna like buy i don't even need to rebuy stuff but it's just i think there's like a part of me and that's like and i know that and it would make it easier because now i don't have to justify anything to anyone i don't even have to tell anyone about all of this you know it makes me wonder maybe that judge on the argentinian show that got caught talking about mexicans was honest
A: yeah but uh you don't have a uh passport remember no one that who
B: not one person
A: no one one
B: the person with the family
A: yeah yeah but but he was uh uh a fake friend because he he tried to use
B: he says no but maybe he's unconscious of it i don't know i kind of need his help so i gotta be friends with him again for a month or two i'm never gonna get that close with him again but like well i mean i'm gonna tell him to his face again when i told him on the phone and be like listen man i'm sorry you just like again like just think i mean i don't know i'm he you know it's interesting because he's been going yeah it's a lot now and and he we had this he started arguing with me about politics and i was like oh we're gonna you a mexican is gonna argue with me an american living in mexico about trump like can we just
A: hello there
B: just to read so and this was supposed to be like my bestest bestest friend right and like again like it's been like a lot of things and even after all of that i was like you know what aaron now uh your spanish is better reset you're able to like kind of see what's going around you know what i mean i'm willing to take all of those years of failure and be like okay let's start from scratch now and then my scratch is still like again like i feel like i have the ability i i know i do i have the the the language skills and social skills to know what's going on around me to observe what's happening to make like and i'm and i'm like okay even with all of these tools like again i could probably meet someone right now who's like friends with a group of people who would all just be amazing people and my best friends
A: but like yeah but in five years you don't know that his
B: cousin had told me that he knew his uh like it's just like so i'm not gonna get close again like for this reason but like i will i'm open to talking and maybe he has something to say that is credible or makes sense
A: but uh i think he he tried to to to make an intent to to to open a dialogue with you yeah with a silly question a weird question
B: could be yeah that that's exactly i don't know so that's that's how i'm taking it i'm not going to take it as uh does anything else and um i actually don't need his help it's a lie i just it would be more convenient um to get a ride to mexico city and then you know if something does happen you know it's weird like i keep making jokes and i think i know myself well
