# Universal Knowledge Base (Gemini MD)

## Core Truths (The Bedrock)
- **Authoritative Source:** `[session_id]_words.json` is the sole anchor for the PCL.
- **Triple-Transcript Artifacts:** Every session creates `raw.txt`, `sentences.json`, and `words.json`.
- **PCL Status:** All syncs are PENDING until Manager approval.
- **Data Source:** Supabase (62k phenomena) is the only source for error patterns.

## Performance & Debugging
- **Async Matcher:** Error patterns are asynchronously cached from Supabase.
- **Global Debug:** DEBUG=true active for 100% visibility.
- **Execution:** No declaring 'done' without Triple-Vector Verification.
